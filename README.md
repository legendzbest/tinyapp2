# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is the first ever web application I have built. To think that a month ago, I didn't even know what an object was and today, I have made a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs is amazing. In retrospect, there are probably a lot of things I could have done to make my code more modular and the HTML better, but the app is functional (to the best of knowledge) and I'm proud to have made it!
